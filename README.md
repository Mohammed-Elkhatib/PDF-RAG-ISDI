# PDF-RAG-ISDI
The project will focus on PDF processing, embedding, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for improving answer accuracy. 
 
### Objective
- **Extract and process text from PDFs, including handling images, tables...**
- **Chunk the text efficiently for better embeddings.**
- **Use transformer-based embedding models to generate semantic representations.**
- **Store these embeddings in a structured way for optimized retrieval.**
- **Implement RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to validate LLM responses.**
- **Apply semantic search techniques to improve the likelihood of retrieving accurate answers.**
